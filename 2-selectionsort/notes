DATA STRUCTURES
=====
Arrays are memory addresses right next to each other like
Lists [linked lists] are independent memory addresses that contain the main data and a pointer to the next item in the data chain

Arrays are best for when you're doing lots of reading because you can access elements without having to wade through the entire chain.
Lists are best for when you're doing lots of writing because the memory addresses do not need to be next to eachother and they're easier to expand. 

Lists:
    reading [O(n)]
    insertion [O(1)]
    deletion [O(1)]

Arrays:
    reading [O(1)]
    insertion [O(n)]
    deletion [O(n)]
