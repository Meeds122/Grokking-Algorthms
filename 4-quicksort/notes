Divide and conquer

Think about how you can split up the problem until it's solvable.

Euclid's algorithm. How to find the greates common denominator
The way the book describes it is to think about a rectangular plot of land. How would you figure the largest square portion you can split it into?

1. let the smaller side = x. Split it into squares of x by x. 
2. If there is no land left, you're largest squuares are x by x. If there is land left, jump to step 1

code

def euclidAlgo(height, width):
    if height == width:
        // Already a square aka base case
        return height
    else if height > width:
        if height % width == 0:
            // Width divides evenly into height, return width as it will square. 
            return width
        // will have to determine whats left and recurse

    else:
        if width % height == 0:
            // Height devides evenly into width, return height as it will square
            return height
