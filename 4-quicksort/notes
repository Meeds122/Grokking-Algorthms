Divide and conquer

Think about how you can split up the problem until it's solvable.

Euclid's algorithm. How to find the greates common denominator
The way the book describes it is to think about a rectangular plot of land. How would you figure the largest square portion you can split it into?

1. let the smaller side = x. Split it into squares of x by x. 
2. If there is no land left, you're largest squuares are x by x. If there is land left, jump to step 1


Quicksort

Quicksort is a devide and conquer algorithm for sorting arrays. It perform in O(n) time in optimal situations, O(nlogn) time on average, and O(2^n) time
in a worst case scenario. 

base cases:
[] -- empty array; return;
[12] -- single element array; return
[2,1] -- 2 elements; sort appropriately then return;

recursive cases:
in any array with a total of elements greater than 2:
    1. Pick pivot (random is best)
    2. Place all larger than pivot in new array
    3. Place all smaller than pivot in new array
    4. call function on new set of arrays
    5. return smallarray + pivot + largerarray
